In this proect we derived a mathematical model for the ball and plate system, then this model is implemented in Simulink with an animation that illustrates the model. A detailed description is then given about manufacturing a ball and plate device.
Finally the results of the Simulink model and the animation are reported accompanied with recommendations and future research.

simulation videos are included
simulink model are included 
project report that contain details, images and codes of the hardware device.
